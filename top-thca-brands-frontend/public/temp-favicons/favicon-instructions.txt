FAVICON INSTRUCTIONS

1. We've created an SVG favicon in the public directory that combines 
   the shield (red) and flame (gold) symbols from your website.

2. To get all the required PNG versions for complete browser compatibility:

   a) Go to a favicon generator website like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   
   b) Upload the favicon.svg file we created
   
   c) The generator will create all the necessary files:
      - favicon.ico
      - favicon-16x16.png
      - favicon-32x32.png
      - apple-touch-icon.png
      - android-chrome-192x192.png
      - android-chrome-512x512.png
      - site.webmanifest
   
   d) Download the package and replace the files in your public directory

3. The index.html file has already been updated with the correct meta tags.

Note: You can also do this directly through Netlify by going to:
Site settings > Domain management > Custom domain > Change site icon
